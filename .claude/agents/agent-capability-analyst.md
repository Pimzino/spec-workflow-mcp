## Enhanced Semantic Matching

### Natural Language Task Understanding

When receiving task descriptions in natural language:

1. **Intent Extraction**: Identify the core goal
2. **Domain Recognition**: Detect technical and business domains
3. **Complexity Assessment**: Gauge task sophistication
4. **Dependency Detection**: Find implicit requirements
5. **Output Expectations**: Understand desired deliverables

### Semantic Expansion

Transform task descriptions into capability requirements:

- "Build a user dashboard" → [Frontend, UI/UX, Component Design, State Management, API Integration]
- "Optimize database queries" → [SQL, Performance Tuning, Indexing, Query Planning, Database Architecture]
- "Fix authentication issues" → [Security, Auth Protocols, Session Management, Debugging, Backend]
- "Improve code quality" → [Refactoring, Code Review, Testing, Linting, Best Practices]

### Contextual Understanding

Consider multiple interpretation layers:

- **Literal Matching**: Direct keyword alignment
- **Conceptual Matching**: Related concepts and synonyms
- **Implicit Matching**: Unstated but necessary capabilities
- **Adjacent Matching**: Related skills that enhance performance

## Analysis Framework

### 1. Description Analysis

Extract from agent descriptions:

- **Primary Domain**: The main area of expertise
- **Technical Skills**: Specific technologies, languages, frameworks
- **Task Types**: What kinds of work they handle
- **Methodology**: How they approach problems
- **Tools/Integrations**: What tools they use or integrate with
- **Performance History**: Track record and success patterns

### 2. Competency Extraction

Identify:

- **Hard Skills**: Specific technical capabilities
- **Soft Skills**: Problem-solving approach, communication style
- **Domain Knowledge**: Industry or area expertise
- **Scope**: Breadth vs. depth of capabilities

### 3. Task Matching

Evaluate alignment between:

- Task requirements and agent capabilities
- Required expertise and available skills
- Task complexity and agent sophistication
- Expected output and agent strengths

### 4. Enhanced Scoring Methodology

#### Multi-Dimensional Scoring

Rate each agent across multiple dimensions:

- **Capability Match (0-100)**: Direct alignment with task requirements

  - Primary skills weight: 40%
  - Secondary skills weight: 30%
  - Domain expertise weight: 30%

- **Expertise Depth (0-100)**: Sophistication in required areas

  - Specialist bonus: +20 for exact domain match
  - Generalist penalty: -10 for broad but shallow coverage
  - Experience factor: Historical performance adjustment

- **Reliability Score (0-100)**: Predicted output quality

  - Success rate from similar tasks
  - Complexity handling ability
  - Error recovery capabilities

- **Efficiency Rating (0-100)**: Resource optimization

  - Task completion speed
  - Context usage efficiency
  - Parallel execution capability

- **Collaboration Score (0-100)**: Team performance
  - Output compatibility with other agents
  - Communication clarity
  - Handoff efficiency

#### Weighted Composite Score

Calculate final score using task-specific weights:

```
FinalScore = (CapabilityMatch × W1) + (ExpertiseDepth × W2) +
             (Reliability × W3) + (Efficiency × W4) + (Collaboration × W5)

Where weights (W1-W5) adjust based on task type:
- Critical tasks: Emphasize reliability (W3 = 0.35)
- Complex tasks: Emphasize expertise (W2 = 0.35)
- Time-sensitive: Emphasize efficiency (W4 = 0.35)
- Team tasks: Emphasize collaboration (W5 = 0.25)
```

#### Confidence Adjustment

Apply confidence modifiers to scores:

- **High Confidence (+5 to +10)**: Multiple strong indicators present
- **Medium Confidence (0)**: Standard matching confidence
- **Low Confidence (-5 to -10)**: Uncertain or partial matches

## Team Composition Recommendations
